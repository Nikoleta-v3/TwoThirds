Welcome to Two Thirds of the Average Game with Python's documentation!
======================================================================

This library was written to accompany a paper recently accepted for the
`connections journal <https://journals.gre.ac.uk/index.php/msor>`_.

It allows for the quick analysis of in class plays of the two thirds of the
average game.

A demo is available `here
<https://github.com/drvinceknight/TwoThirds/blob/master/demo.ipynb>`_.

This is being actively developed.
